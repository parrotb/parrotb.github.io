    <div class="credit_text">
		<p><b>Coding assignment:</b> Coding structure based on Exemplary work for A2 by Lisa Fukushima, found at <a href="https://okalrel.org/demo/s04/exemplary_student_work/fukushima/assign3_about.html" target="_blank">Fukushima's assignment with adjustments</a>
        <p><b>reset.css:</b> Code based on CSS file, <a href="https://okalrel.org/demo/css/demo_reset.css">demo_reset.css</a>, found at <a href="http://okalrel.org/demo/css/" target="_blank">Okal Rel Demo folder</a>. Code modified to set font size = 10px (easier to calculate rem on other pages if base 10).</p>
        <p><b>CSS styling in each html file:</b> Adjusted each padding-bottom for main tags so that there is no white space left.</p>
		<p><b>CSS float:</b> Main tag layout in the <a href="a3_about.html">About</a> page is based on code found in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_float.asp" target="_blank">CSS layout - float and clear</a> and taken from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>. Created CSS styling inside html file as it is specific to the <a href="a3_about.html">About</a> page only. Images are set to specific width and height as well as resized in image editing app so images do not need to take time to load.</p>
        <p><b>Inline block:</b> Content layout for "main" tag on <a href="a3_gallery.html">Gallery</a> page is based on the code from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_image_gallery">CSS image gallery</a> from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a> and also from <a href = "https://okalrel.org/demo/s04/exemplary_student_work/fukushima/assign3_gallery.html">Fukushima's assignment</a>. Adjusted padding and margins so that each box is evenly spaced on the page. As well as adjusted margins and paddings for paragraphs and footers so that the gallery is evenly spaced between the paragraph tag and footer tag.</p>
        <p><b>Topnav:</b> Top navigation code for all three html pages based on code from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp" target="_blank">CSS navbar</a> in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>. Added some changes to the colors. HTML code: div, class; added to three HTML pages, and CSS styling code moved to base.css.</p>
		<p><b>Footerlink:</b> Footer link code, changed color to white so letters are visible on a dark background. Code based on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp" target="_blank">CSS link</a> found on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>.</p>
		<p><b>Horizontal rule:</b> Horizontal rule on Credits page taken from Lisa Fukushima's <a href ="https://okalrel.org/demo/s04/exemplary_student_work/fukushima/assign3_credits.html" target="_blank">About.html</a> page.
